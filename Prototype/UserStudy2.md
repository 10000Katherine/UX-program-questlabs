# User Study 2

## 1. Purpose or Objectives for Prototype Evaluation User Study

The purpose of this usability testing was to validate the effectiveness, usability, and user acceptance of our high-fidelity Figma prototype before final delivery. Our specific objectives were:

### Primary Objectives:

- **Assess Overall Usability:** Measure system usability using the standardized System Usability Scale (SUS) to determine if our prototype meets industry standards (target: SUS≥70)
- **Validate Core Features:** Confirm that all four core features (Daily Check-in, Progress Dashboard, Goal Framework, Cohort Space) meet user needs and expectations
- **Test Task Completion:** Evaluate whether users can successfully complete key workflows (check-in, progress review, goal creation, cohort interaction) without assistance
- **Verify Privacy-First Design:** Validate that our privacy-preserving approach to cohort features resonates with users and addresses the 71% user need for privacy control identified in our initial research
- **Identify Usability Issues:** Discover painpoints, confusion areas, and friction in user flows that need addressing before final delivery
- **Measure Feature Value:** Determine which features users find most/least valuable to validate our feature prioritization decisions
- **Gauge Adoption Intent:** Measure user willingness to download and use the app to assess product-market fit
- **Validate Initial Research:** Confirm that our earlier research findings (14-person survey) accurately informed our design decisions

### What We Hoped to Learn:

- Does the three-tier goal framework (Vision→Quarterly→Weekly) make sense to users?
- Can users complete daily check-ins in under 2 minutes as designed?
- Are the progress visualizations (charts, Wheel of Life) clear and valuable?
- Does the privacy-first cohort design strike the right balance between social support and privacy?
- What aspects of the app work well and should be maintained?
- What needs improvement or causes confusion?
- Would users actually use this app in their daily lives?

## 2. Choice of User Study and User Sample

### User Study Method: Remote Moderated Usability Testing

We chose remote moderated usability testing as our primary user study method because:

- **Direct Observation:** Allows us to observe users interacting with the prototype in real-time and identify usability issues as they occur
- **Think-Aloud Protocol:** Participants verbalize their thoughts, providing insight into their decision-making process and expectations
- **Task-Based Evaluation:** Tests specific user scenarios (check-in, progress review, goal management, cohort interaction) that represent core app workflows
- **Mixed Methods:** Combines quantitative data (SUS scores, task completion rates, ratings) with qualitative feedback (open-ended responses, observations)
- **Flexibility:** Allows moderator to ask follow-up questions and probe deeper into user confusion or delight
- **Realistic Context:** Remote testing allows participants to use the prototype in their natural environment (home, dorm room)

### Study Components:

1. **Task Completion Testing (15-18 minutes)**

   - 4 core tasks representing primary user journeys
   - Think-aloud protocol during task execution
   - Observation of user behavior, hesitations, and errors

2. **Post-Test Survey (5-7 minutes)**
   - System Usability Scale (SUS) - 10 standardized questions
   - Feature importance ratings
   - Task-specific feedback
   - Open-ended feedback questions
   - Total: 27 questions

**Testing Period:** November 25-27, 2025
**Duration per Participant:** 20-25 minutes
**Platform:** Figma Interactive Prototype (remote access)

### Target Users and Sample:

We specifically recruited participants who match our primary persona "Aspirational Reflectors":

#### Inclusion Criteria:

- College students aged 18-31+
- Currently enrolled in or interested in personal development/growth programs
- High comfort level with mobile applications
- Willing to provide honest, detailed feedback
- Available for 20-25 minute remote testing session

#### Sample Demographics (n=5):

**Demographic Distribution**

- Age Range 20% (18-20 years)
- 40% (27-30 years)
- 40% (31+ years)
- Tech Proficiency 100% "Very comfortable with mobile apps"
- Student Status All current or recent college students

#### Sample Size Justification:

While 5 participants is a small sample, it is appropriate for qualitative usability testing:

- Nielsen Norman Group research shows 5 users discover 85% of usability problems
- Our focus was qualitative insight, not statistical generalization
- Mixed-methods approach (task observation + SUS + open feedback) provides rich data
- Consistent patterns emerged across all 5 participants, indicating data saturation

#### Perspective:

We used a single-perspective approach focusing exclusively on college students because:

- Our app is designed specifically for students in cohort-based personal development programs
- Students are both the end-users and decision-makers for app adoption
- Unlike dual-perspective apps (e.g., LMS with student/faculty views), our app serves one primary user type
- Program facilitators (secondary users) were not included in this study as they interact with aggregated cohort data, not the primary app interface

Note: While we did not conduct separate studies for program facilitators, this could be valuable future research to understand their needs for cohort monitoring dashboards.

### VALIDATED STRENGTHS

**Insight 1: Strong Overall Usability (SUS: 78.0)**
Our prototype achieved above-average usability (78.0/100, Grade B), placing it in the top 25% of products. The app is easy to use (4.8/5), quick to learn (4.4/5), and highly consistent (5.0/5).

**Implication:** Our iterative design process successfully created an intuitive, learnable interface.

**Insight 2: Privacy-First Cohort Design is a Validated Differentiator**
100% of participants felt comfortable with our privacy-preserving cohort features. Users specifically appreciated the "aggregated view" approach.

User Quote: "I really like the 'Aggregated Cohort' view. It feels supportive to see my group's collective progress without the pressure of sharing private reflections or competing on a leaderboard."

**Implication:** This addresses the 71% user need for privacy control identified in initial research.

**Insight 3: Three-Tier Goal Framework Validates Unique Value Proposition**
80% immediately understood the Vision→Quarterly→Weekly structure. Users see high value in connecting daily habits to long-term vision (4.6/5 importance).

**Implication:** Our hypothesis was correct - this is a differentiating feature.

**Insight 4: Visual Progress Dashboard Highly Effective**
100% of users found charts and graphs clear. Progress review had highest task ease (4.6/5).

**Implication:** Our data visualization approach successfully meets user preferences.

**Insight 5: All Core Features Highly Valued**
All four core features scored 4.6-4.8/5 in importance, with 60-80% rating each as "Very Important".

**Implication:** Feature prioritization based on initial research was accurate.

### CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED

**Insight 7: Lack of Cohort Interaction Features is #1 User Frustration (60% mentioned)**
While users loved the privacy-first design, 60% expressed frustration at not being able to interact. Users want to send encouragement, see notifications, and celebrate milestones.

"Sometimes I want to send a short 'Keep it up' text message to the group, but I can't"

**Implication:** We overcorrected by removing too much interaction. Need privacy-preserving interaction features.

**Impact:** High - This is the #1 user request

**Desired Features:**

- Notification center for team activity
- Quick reactions/encouragement (emoji)
- Team milestone celebrations
- Anonymous supportive messages

**Insight 8: Habit Formation and Reminders Critical for Retention**
20% directly mentioned forgetting to check-in daily. Users expressed "fear of due time" (deadline anxiety).

"I'm a lazy casual guy. It's highly likely I'll forget to check in update tasks every day"

**Implication:** Daily habit formation is critical, but we lack reminder/notification system.

**Impact:** High - Affects daily engagement and retention

**Insight 9: Some UI Elements Non-Clickable, Breaking User Expectations**
20% mentioned "some icons cannot be clicked", indicating prototype gaps that break user trust.

**Impact:** Medium - Affects user confidence

**Insight 10: Wheel of Life Color Contrast Needs Improvement**
20% mentioned poor color contrast, making it "hard to be distinguished".

**Impact:** Medium - Affects clarity of key visualization

### SECONDARY INSIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES
